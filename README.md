### How to setup this code

First of all

git clone https://github.com/lokesh010/TakeATest.git
```
then go inside folder you can see `backend` folder and `frontend` folder

then inside backend folder copy `env.example` file to `.env`

then run backend

first you need to install whole package,

`npm install`

then

`npm start` (I have installed nodemon)
`npm run dev` (to run react and nodemon concurrently, iif `npm i` has run inside frontend )

That's it for backend

then go to the `frontend` folder

`npm install`

`npm start`

Thats it<:
