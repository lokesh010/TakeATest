## This is a NODEJS,React and MYSQL

### How to setup this code

First of all

create database named `takeatest` and execute all commands from takeAtest.sql in home dir
Then

```
git clone https://github.com/lokesh010/TakeATest.git
```

then go inside folder and you can see `backend` folder and `frontend` folder

then inside backend folder copy `env.example` file to `.env` with your environment variables

now you need to install whole package,

`npm install`

then

`npm start` (I have installed nodemon)
`npm run dev` (to run react and nodemon concurrently, iif `npm i` has run inside frontend )
(react build file included in git)

That's it for backend

then go to the `frontend` folder

first you need to install whole package

`npm install`

then

`npm start`

Thats it

note: if you face any problem then please contact with me through phone or email.
